Today, I would like to go through the next set of criteria for AI systems that qualify as high risk under the EU AI Act:

(2). Management and operation of critical infrastructure
under "critical infrastructure" the act considers the following:

   (a) AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and health of persons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct of social and economic activities. 
 
(3). Education and vocational training:

   (a) AI systems intended to be used for the purpose of determining access or assigning natural persons to educational and vocational training institutions;

   (b) AI systems intended to be used for the purpose of assessing students in educational and vocational training institutions and for assessing participants in tests commonly required for admission to educational institutions.

This sounds interesting. The main reason for this is that such AI systems may determine the educational and professional course of a person's life, and therefore affect their ability to secure their livelihood. When improperly designed and used, these systems may violate the right to education and training, as well as the right not to be discriminated against, and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination. Therefore, if an AI system is used to evaluate students in educational and vocational training institutions, it will be considered a high-risk AI system.

(4). Employment, workers management and access to self-employment:
   (a) AI systems intended to be used for recruitment or selection of natural persons, notably for advertising vacancies, screening or filtering applications, evaluating candidates in the course of interviews or tests;
   AI systems that assist HR in their daily work, such as resume screening, candidate ranking, interview scheduling, etc., will be considered high-risk AI systems. 
   (b) AI intended to be used for making decisions on promotion and termination of work-related contractual relationships, for task allocation and for monitoring and evaluating performance and behavior of persons in such relationships.
   From the less obvious part - AI systems are used to evaluate the performance of athletes and taxi drivers. Frankly speaking, it's quite a large market where AI systems excel.
